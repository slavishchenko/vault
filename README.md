# vault

I have at least one account on every site on the internet... Seriously. <br>
Remembering all those usernames and passwords is kind of a difficult task... for a human, at least.

That's why I've built **_Vault_**; a simple, console program that remembers my login information so I don't have to!

******
This was my first _"big"_ Python project. <br> 
It was good practice for writing conditional logic, classes, and getting input from users. <br> 
Also, for this project, I had to learn how to register users, encrypt/decrypt passwords, and basic SQL.
